IMPORTANT
====================
Since RPly 1.1 64bit systems are oficially supported. As the 64bit support was
the major difference between librply and the old RPly version almost all
modifications became obsolete.

#### So this is now merely a copy of the oficial RPly with some additional
 ### examples and Makefiles. The “important” code is the same as on the
  ## original RPly homepage.  I will however keep this up to date as a couple
   # of my other tools depend on this as shared library.

ABOUT
====================
RPly: ANSI C Library for PLY file format input and output 

RPly is a library originally written by Diego Nehab, that lets applications
read and write PLY files. The PLY file format is widely used to store geometric
information, such as 3D models, but is general enough to be useful for other
purposes.



COMPILATION
====================
For compilation of the library simply call
% make

Furthermore you can create some example programs by calling
% make test
