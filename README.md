# LibRPLY

ANSI C Library for PLY file format input and output.

RPly is a library originally written by Diego Nehab, that lets applications
read and write PLY files. The PLY file format is widely used to store geometric
information, such as 3D models, but is general enough to be useful for other
purposes.

This library is based on RPly 1.1.3 http://w3.impa.br/~diego/software/rply/
